For the Kubernetes developer platform, the lead scoring rubric should be tailored to prioritize profiles that indicate a need for Kubernetes orchestration, DevOps capabilities, and an interest in infrastructure management. Hereâ€™s how you can score leads based on the metadata and labels from the shared profiles format:

Lead Scoring Rubric for Kubernetes Developer Platform:

Industry and Technological Relevance (0-5 points):

Labels indicating tech industry, especially cloud, AI, or data analytics: +5
Labels indicating industries that often use Kubernetes (e.g., software development): +4
Labels indicating unrelated industries: +0

Professional Role and Influence (0-5 points):

Labels indicating senior technology leadership (e.g., CTO, VP of Engineering): +5
Labels indicating roles in DevOps, cloud architecture, or infrastructure: +4
Labels indicating junior or non-technical roles: +1
No relevant role information: +0

Technical Needs and Pain Points (0-5 points):

Labels indicating a need for scaling, containerization, or orchestration: +5
Labels indicating interest in DevOps tooling and automation: +4
Labels indicating general technology needs without specifics: +2
No labels indicating relevant technical needs: +0

Networking and Community Engagement (0-3 points):

Labels with 500+ connections or evidence of active community engagement: +3
Labels indicating moderate networking activity: +1
No labels indicating networking or community engagement: +0

Geographical Focus (0-2 points):

Labels indicating the location in recognized tech hubs or regions with high Kubernetes adoption: +2
Labels indicating other locations: +1
No location specified: +0

Company Size (0-3 points):

Labels from profiles of individuals in large enterprises (more likely to use Kubernetes at scale): +3
Labels from profiles of individuals in medium-sized companies: +2
Labels from profiles of individuals in small companies or startups: +1
Current Solutions and Engagement (0-5 points):

Labels indicating use of competing Kubernetes management platforms (potential switchers): +5
Labels indicating use of cloud services (potential for Kubernetes integration): +4
Labels indicating no current solutions or lack of engagement with relevant platforms: +0

Scoring Interpretation:

23-28 points: High priority lead. Strong alignment with Kubernetes platform needs and likely to be highly interested.
15-22 points: Medium priority lead. Some signals of alignment but may need more nurturing or information.
8-14 points: Low priority lead. Limited signals of alignment, requiring further qualification.
0-7 points: Not a priority. Unlikely to need a Kubernetes orchestration platform at this time.
