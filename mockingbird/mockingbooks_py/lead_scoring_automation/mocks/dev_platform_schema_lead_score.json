Here\u2019s how you can score leads based on the metadata and labels from the shared profiles format:\n\nLead Scoring Rubric for Kubernetes Developer Platform:\n\nIndustry and Technological Relevance (0-5 points):\n\nLabels indicating tech industry, especially cloud, AI, or data analytics: +5\nLabels indicating industries that often use Kubernetes (e.g., software development): +4\nLabels indicating unrelated industries: +0\n\nProfessional Role and Influence (0-5 points):\n\nLabels indicating senior technology leadership (e.g., CTO, VP of Engineering): +5\nLabels indicating roles in DevOps, cloud architecture, or infrastructure: +4\nLabels indicating junior or non-technical roles: +1\nNo relevant role information: +0\n\nTechnical Needs and Pain Points (0-5 points):\n\nLabels indicating a need for scaling, containerization, or orchestration: +5\nLabels indicating interest in DevOps tooling and automation: +4\nLabels indicating general technology needs without specifics: +2\nNo labels indicating relevant technical needs: +0\n\nNetworking and Community Engagement (0-3 points):\n\nLabels with 500+ connections or evidence of active community engagement: +3\nLabels indicating moderate networking activity: +1\nNo labels indicating networking or community engagement: +0\n\nGeographical Focus (0-2 points):\n\nLabels indicating the location in recognized tech hubs or regions with high Kubernetes adoption: +2\nLabels indicating other locations: +1\nNo location specified: +0\n\nCompany Size (0-3 points):\n\nLabels from profiles of individuals in large enterprises (more likely to use Kubernetes at scale): +3\nLabels from profiles of individuals in medium-sized companies: +2\nLabels from profiles of individuals in small companies or startups: +1\nCurrent Solutions and Engagement (0-5 points):\n\nLabels indicating use of competing Kubernetes management platforms (potential switchers): +5\nLabels indicating use of cloud services (potential for Kubernetes integration): +4\nLabels indicating no current solutions or lack of engagement with relevant platforms: +0\n\nScoring Interpretation:\n\n23-28 points: High priority lead. Strong alignment with Kubernetes platform needs and likely to be highly interested.\n15-22 points: Medium priority lead. Some signals of alignment but may need more nurturing or information.\n8-14 points: Low priority lead. Limited signals of alignment, requiring further qualification.\n0-7 points: Not a priority. Unlikely to need a Kubernetes orchestration platform at this time.",
